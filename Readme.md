## Today Just Started Learning JavaScript from Apna Collage

# <p align='center'> Day 1 </p>

- JavaScript { JS is a dynamically typed ( mean don't need to tell which type of data we are going to store in a variable ) programming language. we use it to give instructions th the computer }

- Ctrl + k ( use to clear the console log in your browser )

- Install Visual Studio Code ( It is free & Popular code editor by Microsoft )

- `console.log ("Apna Collage");` Console.log is used to log ( Print ) a message to the console

- `.js` means that this file is the JavaScript file

- To connect the JavaScript with the browser we have to create `HTML` file to run the JavaScript code on browser 

- VS code provide us a Boilerplate for `HTML` like `!` when your just enter it this will create the basic code of `HTML` for you

- Now to connect the `javascript` file with `HTML` you have to write Script tag within the `HTML` file and add the path in the `src` attribute

## <p align='center'> Topic 1 : Variables in JavaScript</p>
- Variables are containers for data , that is used to store data
#### <p align='center'>Types of variables</p>
1. Int Variable ( 1 , 3 , 434 )
2. float Variable ( 1.23 , 34.3 )
3. String Variable ( 'food' , 'zahid')
4. Boolean Variable ( 'True', 'False' )
5. Null variable ( means nothing inside the variable ) `( name = 'null' )`
6. undefined variable ( means this is not defined ) `( name = 'undefined' )`

#### <p align='center'> Variables Name Rules in JavaScript</p>
- Variables names are case sensitive ( a & A is different )
- Only letters, digits and underscore ( _ ) are allowed. ( not even space )
- Only Letter, underscore ` _ ` or `$` should be 1st character.

- [Reserved words](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#reserved_words)  ( these words are used for special work like console is the reserved words use for printing something on screen ) cannot be variables names.

#### <p align='center'> Variables Names Keywords in JavaScript</p>
- We can create variables without keywords like `( var , let , const )` but this is not good practice you have to use variables keywords

- `Var` Variable can be re-declared & updated in JavaScript, A global scope variable ( means you can use it where you want in a program ), before 2015 people use var variable after in 2015 we got ES6 the advanced version of JavaScript after that we have `let` and `const`

- `Let` Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable ( means that you can only use it only in a block of code mean in a specific place )
- `Const` Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scop variable, We can use Constant variables in special cases like for the value of `PI` <br> `Note` if we have `const` object we can change the object key only not the whole object

-  `Note` if you are declaring a variable with no value assigned to it for `let` and `var` variable it will return `undefined` but in the case of `const` it will give an error 

## <p align='center'> Topic 2: Data Types in JavaScript</p>
- Data type define the type of the data that a variable can store
#### <p align='center'> There are two Categories of Data Types in JavaScript</p>
- `Primitive data type` Primitive data types are fixed data types that are predefined there are 7 Primitive data types in JavaScript that are given below
<div align='center'>
1. Number <br>
2. String <br>
3. Boolean<br>
4. Undefined<br>
5. Null <br>
6. BigInt (Big integer) <br>
7. Symbol <br>
</div>

<br>

- `None Primitive data type` Objects are the None Primitive data types, Objects are contained arrays and functions. Objects is the collection of the values, objects are key value pairs <br> `Note` you can check the code of object in javascript file


<br>
<br>

## Special Functions in JavaScript
1. `typeof` this function will return the type of that variable which you pass inside it like `typeof(name);`
