## Today Just Started Learning JavaScript from Apna Collage

# Day 1

- Javascript ( JS is a programming language. we use it to give instructions th the computer )

- Ctrl + k ( use to clear the console log in your browser )

- Install Visual Studio Code ( It is free & Popular code editor by Microsoft )

- `console.log ("Apna Collage");` Console.log is used to log ( Print ) a message to the console

- `.js` means that this file is the JavaScript file

- To connect the JavaScript with the browser we have to create `HTML` file to run the JavaScript code on browser 

- VS code provide us a Boilerplate for `HTML` like `!` when your just enter it this will create the basic code of `HTML` for you

- Now to connect the `javascript` file with `HTML` you have to write Script tag within the `HTML` file and add the path in the `src` attribute
